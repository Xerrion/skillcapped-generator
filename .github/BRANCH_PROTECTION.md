# Branch Protection Setup

This document explains how to configure branch protection rules to ensure the test workflow must pass before merging.

## GitHub Branch Protection Configuration

To require the test workflow to pass before merging, follow these steps:

### 1. Navigate to Branch Protection Settings

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Click on **Branches** in the left sidebar
4. Click **Add rule** or edit existing rule for your main branch

### 2. Configure Branch Protection Rule

Set up the following options:

#### Branch name pattern
- `master` (or `main` depending on your default branch)

#### Protect matching branches
- ‚úÖ **Require a pull request before merging**
  - ‚úÖ Require approvals: `1`
  - ‚úÖ Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
  - ‚úÖ Require review from code owners (if you have CODEOWNERS file)

- ‚úÖ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
  - ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
  - **Required status checks:**
    - `Test Suite (ubuntu-latest, stable)`
    - `Test Suite (windows-latest, stable)`  
    - `Test Suite (macos-latest, stable)`
    - `Test Suite (ubuntu-latest, nightly)`
    - `Code Coverage`
    - `Security Audit`
    - `Integration Tests (ubuntu-latest)`
    - `Integration Tests (windows-latest)`
    - `Integration Tests (macos-latest)`
    - `Minimum Rust Version`
    - `Test Results Summary`

- ‚úÖ **Require conversation resolution before merging**

- ‚úÖ **Restrict pushes that create files that exceed GitHub's file size limit**

#### Additional Options (Recommended)
- ‚úÖ **Include administrators** (applies rules to repository admins too)
- ‚úÖ **Allow force pushes** ‚Üí **Everyone** (disable this for stricter control)
- ‚úÖ **Allow deletions** (disable this to prevent branch deletion)

### 3. Automatic Status Check Detection

After creating a few pull requests, GitHub will automatically detect the status checks from your workflow. You can then add them to the required checks list.

## Workflow Features

The test workflow (`tests.yml`) includes:

### ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Testing**
- **Multi-platform**: Tests on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS
- **Multi-version**: Tests on stable and nightly Rust
- **All test types**: Unit tests and integration tests

### ‚úÖ **Code Quality Checks**
- **Formatting**: `cargo fmt --check`
- **Linting**: `cargo clippy` with strict warnings

### ‚úÖ **Security & Reliability**
- **Security Audit**: `cargo audit` for known vulnerabilities
- **MSRV Check**: Ensures compatibility with minimum Rust version (1.70.0)
- **Code Coverage**: Generates coverage reports with `cargo-llvm-cov`

### ‚úÖ **Integration Testing**
- **Binary Execution**: Tests that built binaries can actually run
- **Cross-platform**: Verifies binary works on all target platforms

### ‚úÖ **Performance Optimizations**
- **Caching**: Cargo registry and build caches for faster runs
- **Fail-fast**: Disabled to see all failures, not just the first one
- **Matrix Strategy**: Efficient parallel testing across platforms

## Triggering the Workflow

The workflow runs on:
- **Push** to `master`, `main`, or `develop` branches
- **Pull requests** targeting these branches  
- **Manual dispatch** for testing

## Expected Behavior

Once configured:

1. **Developer creates PR** ‚Üí Tests automatically run
2. **Tests must pass** ‚Üí All jobs must succeed (green ‚úÖ)
3. **Review required** ‚Üí At least 1 approval needed
4. **Merge enabled** ‚Üí Only when tests pass and review approved
5. **Failed tests** ‚Üí Merge button disabled until fixed

## Monitoring

- **PR Status**: Shows test results directly in PR interface
- **Actions Tab**: Detailed logs for all test runs
- **Coverage Reports**: Uploaded to Codecov (if configured)
- **Security Alerts**: Cargo audit results in workflow logs

This setup ensures high code quality and prevents broken code from entering the main branch! üõ°Ô∏è
